# Screenshots & Visual Assets

This folder holds images referenced by the README.

## Required screenshots (capture from the Extension Development Host)

| File | What to capture |
|------|-----------------|
| `screenshot-command-palette.png` | Command Palette showing "CodeComfy: Generate Image (HQ)" |
| `screenshot-statusbar.png` | Status bar during generation ("Generating...") and after ("Done") |
| `screenshot-output.png` | Output channel showing structured log lines |

## Optional

| File | What to capture |
|------|-----------------|
| `demo.gif` | 10–15 s: type prompt → generate → see output in gallery |
| `screenshot-gallery.png` | NextGallery showing a generated image/video grid |

## Guidelines

- Capture at **1280×800** or similar (readable without squinting).
- Use a **neutral VS Code theme** (Dark+ or Light+) so images work in both.
- Crop to the relevant area — no full-desktop screenshots.
- Compress PNGs with `optipng` or `pngquant` before committing.
- GIFs should be ≤ 5 MB for fast README loads.
